# Fake News Detection

## Overview

Fake News Detection is a machine learning project aimed at automatically identifying and classifying fake news articles from legitimate ones. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the textual content of news articles and determine their credibility.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the Fake News Detection model consists of labeled examples of news articles, indicating whether each article is fake or real. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Algorithms Used

- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM, GRU)

## Usage

To run the Fake News Detection model:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/VIGNESH-PROJECTWORK/Fake-News-Deduction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Fake-News-Deduction

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script:

python fake_news_detection.py

Follow the instructions provided to input a sample news article and see the model's classification result.

## Results

The performance of the Fake News Detection model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are presented in the project report along with visualizations to assess the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between fake and real news articles.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Fake News Detection project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the model, adding new features, or fixing bugs, please feel free to submit a pull request.
